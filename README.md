Part 3: Hands-on Practical Case 1 – Supervised Learning (1 hour)
Case:
Predicting house prices using a linear regression model.

Steps:

Importing and exploring the dataset
Preprocessing: handling missing data, scaling
Training a linear regression model
Evaluating the model with mean squared error
Visualizing predictions
Tools:

Python, Jupyter Notebook
Libraries: pandas, sklearn, matplotlib
Deliverable:
Participants create a simple predictive model and interpret its output.

Break (10 minutes)
Part 4: Hands-on Practical Case 2 – Unsupervised Learning (1 hour)
Case:
Clustering customers using a k-means algorithm.

Steps:

Importing the dataset (e.g., customer spending data)
Preprocessing: normalization, feature selection
Training a k-means clustering model
Evaluating clusters with inertia
Visualizing clusters using PCA (if necessary)
Tools:

Python, Jupyter Notebook
Libraries: pandas, sklearn, seaborn
Deliverable:
Participants group similar customers and interpret cluster patterns.

Part 5: Discussion and Next Steps (20 minutes)
Content:

Recap of key takeaways
Common challenges and how to overcome them
Resources for further learning (books, courses, projects)
Activity:

Open Q&A and feedback session
